# Tetris
## Description
I made this game in order to improve my knowledge on OOP concepts, inheritance and polymorphism

## Features
I added some features in addition to classic tetris features:

### Joker
The joker is a special piece.
It will apeear quite rare, and it's very useful.
It's a single asterisk, and it can pass through pieces.
Press 's' anytime to stop it.

### Bomb
Once in contact with another piece, it will blow anything on 3X3 radius.

### Immediate down
Press 'z' anytime, to get the current falling piece to the bottom.

### Music
The game has 8-bit style soundtrack.
